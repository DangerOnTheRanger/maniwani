    <h1 id="whats-an-imageboard">What's an imageboard?</h1>
    <p class="lead">An imageboard is kind of like a forum.</p>
    <p>But a bit more image-focused, and temporary in nature. You post images you like to spark
        discussion and get others to post similar images. Also, unlike a forum, threads don't last
        indefinitely. Old threads that have either been around for a certain period of time, or that
        nobody is posting in any longer, get removed to make way for new threads. This helps keep
        discussion focused on new and relevant things and prevent the site from getting tunnel vision
        on any particular topic. If you don't see anyone discussing a topic you'd like to see talked
        about, just make a thread!</p>
    <p>You might also be wondering why everyone is anonymous, especially if you're used to some of
        the larger social media networks out there. There's a pretty good reason for this, actually:
        The content of each post should be more important than the identity of whoever posted it.
        With everyone being anonymous, a lot of harmful by-products of usernames on other sites are
        no longer possible:
    <ul>
        <li>Trawling a user's post history to bring up irrelevant things to discredit a post or
            argument of theirs
        </li>
        <li>Forming a cult of personality around one user or a group of users</li>
        <li>Making false appeals to authority based on whoever made a post</li>
    </ul>
    You can still tell who is who on a per-thread basis by checking the "Posted by:" field - this
    is to prevent a single person from making intentionally weak arguments on a side they disagree
    with (a practice known as false-flagging) and for certain threads where the identity of a certain
    poster is important - if someone is relaying a live event, for example.

    <h1 id="why-maniwani">Why Maniwani? There's other imageboards out there.</h1>
    <p class="lead">Maniwani's just better.</p>
    <p>But seriously, Maniwani has had a lot of thought and effort put into its design, especially
        on the visual side of things. If you're new to the concept of imageboards, you'll probably
        find Maniwani easier to get the hang of compared to the competition. It also makes sure not
        to leave mobile users out in the cold - the site was written from the ground up such that
        mobile users wouldn't need to use a 3rd-party client just to have an enjoyable experience on
        their phones and tablets!</p>
    <p>For the techies, Maniwani also includes a full REST API capable of doing anything the web frontend
        can do, in addition to gracefully downgrading if Javascript has been disabled.</p>
    <h1 id="what-topics">What topics can I talk about here?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Plenty!</p>
    <p>Go look at the <a href="{{ url_for("boards.list") }}">board listing</a> to get an idea of the sort of
        things you can talk about.</p>
